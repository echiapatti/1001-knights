1001 Knights: Game Synopsis
===========================

In the 1001 Knights Universe, God is a Black Woman. If you were expecting an old white man with a beard, then please move along and go play South Park on your XBox.

Why 1001 Jedi Knights?
----------------------

There is only 1 true master of all masters (head of the Jedi Order). There is room in the game for 1000 other masters maximum.

1001 Knights is a word play on the Classic Persian Fairy Tale "Alf Layla wa Layla", in which a princess avoids execution by telling the King an intereseting story overnight, keeping herself alive by revealing the ending to each of the 1001 stories in the next morning.

1001 Knights combines aspects of Star Wars and Minecraft. The game has two modes, planet mode and space mode.

Gameplay modes
--------------

Imagine Mine Craft (Planet Mode) mixed with Star Wars (Space Mode).

In planet mode, you can collobarate with other planet builders to create your ideal world with farms, cities and advances defefences. The game operates on the Kardeshev scale:

The Kardashev Scale
-------------------

The Kardashev Scale is a purely hypothetical scale for measuring a civilization's technological prowess based on the amount of energy it has available to it. It was devised in 1964 by a Soviet Astronomer, Nikolai Kardashev.

It first appeared in his paper, Transmission of Information by Extraterrestrial Civilizations.

A Type I Civilisation
---------------------

Type 1, as defined by Kardashev, is one still limited to one planet. But, critically, to have reached this level on the scale, the civilization must be able to harness all the energy available there.

For them, nuclear fusion is probably child's play as well as harnessing the antimatter. Other power sources from geothermal to other renewables would also be a given.

Try to think of something like the planet Coruscant in the Star Wars Universe (but without the larger Republic/Empire), or the great works of Asimov. 

A Type II Civilisation
----------------------

Type II civilizations are those that have managed to harness all the power of their local sun. An example strategy would be the ability to construct a Dyson Sphere around it. 

These hypothetical devices would completely surround a star and be able to collect all of its energy. This would require quite the level of technological ability, to say the least.

They would also likely have colonized multiple planets in their local solar system. For them, extinction is a long-lost fantasy. 

Little, if anything, would be able to kill them off, save themselves or a massive inter-species war.

A Type III Civilisation
-----------------------

A Type III Civilisation, or galactic civilization, would be able to control energy across many star systems and planets. The scale of their technological ability would be something beyond our current understanding and, possibly, imagination.

Some estimates have put this at about 10 Billion times the energy output of a Type II Civilisation. Who knows what else this kind of civilization would be able to achieve. 

This would be something akin galaxy-spanning empires common in science fiction. From Star Trek, Star Wars, to the Imperium of Mankind in the Warhammer 40,000 Universe, they would be masters of the Universe. 

But they would still need to obey the laws of physics. Travel between each corner of the civilization would not be possible unless they had managed to circumvent the constraints of the speed of light.

Needless to say, this would be a people who have really made it - so to speak.
